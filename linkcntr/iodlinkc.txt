Description:

    The LinkContainer part is a sample part which demonstrates linking across
    OpenDoc parts and documents.  It is available on the Windows 95/NT, OS/2,
    and AIX platforms.

Files:

    iodlinkc.txt    --  This file.
    iodlinkc.idl    --  SOM idl definitions for SOM class LinkContainer and
                        meta class M_LinkContainer.
    iodlinkc.cpp    --  Class member functions + global objects
    iodlinkc.def    --  Library definitions
    makefile        --  NMAKE file (To build part run: nmake)


How to Build:

    To build this part you will need the OpenDoc Release 1.1 toolkit.

    From the linkcntr source directory run

    nmake

    To register the part with OpenDoc, run

    nmake ForceRegistry

Usage:

    To run the LinkContainer, issue the command:

    docshell -k LinkContainer

    Other parts can now be embedded in the LinkContainer.  When you copy a part
    to the clipboard and then select Paste As, the copied part becomes a link
    source, and the pasted part becomes a link destination.  Any changes in
    the link source should be reflected in the link destination.

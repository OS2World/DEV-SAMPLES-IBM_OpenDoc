This is a sample shell plugin that installs a dispatch module to log
incoming events from the window system and mark the document dirty
when the document window is moved. The event is logged in the message
logging utility provided by OpenDoc. This shell plugin sample is written 
for Windows and OS/2 platforms only. The sample contains the following 
files:

  ioddspm.h - includes the mapping of the message id to descriptive
              message text to be logged
  ioddspm.idl - idl description for sample dispatch monitor
  ioddspm.cpp - source code for the sample dispatch monitor to log
                incoming events and mark the document dirty when 
                moving the document window
  iodshpin.cpp - source code containing the entry point for shell
                 plugin

To build the sample shell plugin library, simply run 'buildme' to execute 
the command file located in this directory. The buildme file does the 
following:

- run the SampEnv command file if it is not already run
- build the sample shell plugin library
- set ODSHELLPLUGINS environment variable for Windows platform

Description:

    The PageLayout part is a sample part which demonstrates pagination
    and printing.  It is available on the Windows 95/NT and OS/2 platforms.
    You can use the PageLayout part to control the alignment of components
    within a document, to control placement of content on multiple pages of a
    document, and to determine the printer setup for a document.  PageLayout
    also provides the pagination framework for documents, such as
    margins, page orientation, page numbering, headers, and footers.

    Page Layout must be used as a root component for documents longer
    than one page with consecutive page numbering.  Although Page Layout
    can serve as an embedded part, its usefulness is greatly diminished in
    that capacity; it can only actually control the layout of the printed
    pages when it is the root part of the document.

How to Build:

    To build this part you will need the OpenDoc Release 1.1 toolkit.

    From the pagepart source directory run

    nmake

    To register the part with OpenDoc, run

    nmake ForceRegistry

Usage:

    To run the PageLayout part, issue the command:

    docshell -k PageLayout

    Other parts can now be embedded in the PageLayout part via
    the Embed Menu.  The Colors menu allows you to change the
    background color of the PageLayout part, the page color, or
    the color of the rulers, margin, and alignment grid.

    Additional pages can be added or removed via the Page menu.
    The Page menu also allows you to add a default header and footer
    to each page in the document.

    The View menu contains additional options to allow you to display
    rulers along the top and left sides of each page, and to display the
    margins or alignment grid on the page itself.

    The Fill Entire Page option on the Edit menu will allow a selected
    part to be expanded to fill a page.  The Snap to Grid option on
    the Edit menu allows selected parts to be moved and resized to fit
    within the nearest corners of the alignment grid.


Design Notes:

    The PageLayout sample currently runs on the Windows 95/NT,
    and OS/2 platforms.  It subclasses from the BaseContainer part
    and from the ODPrintExtension to expand upon the default
    printing behavior provided by the BaseContainer.
    It also uses the ODScrollExtension to allow the user
    to create a multi-page document within a single display frame.
    The Page Layout part demonstrates frame negotiation; it always
    keeps embedded parts within the margins of each page.


Known Restrictions:

    Page Layout is currently unable to print long documents to
    certain printers (the higher the vertical dots-per-inch of the
    printer, the less pages will be able to be printed).  The formula
    for the maximum number of pages that can be printed is:
    
    MaxPages = 32768/((page height in inches+1)*(vertical printer dpi))+1
    
    For example, a 720x360 dpi printer using 11-inch tall paper would
    have a maximum printable page limit of 32768/(12*360)+1, or 8 pages.

    To work around this limitation, either decrease the resolution of the
    printout (via Job Properties on the printer), or split up the printout
    into multiple documents.

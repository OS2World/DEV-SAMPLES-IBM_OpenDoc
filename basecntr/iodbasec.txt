Description:

    The BaseContainer part is a subclassable sample part which demonstrates
    several OpenDoc protocols such as registration, embedding, internalization,
    externalization, cloning, multiple selection, drag/drop, and clipboard
    operations.  It is available on the Windows 95/NT, OS/2, and AIX platforms.

    The BaseContainer part does not have intrinsic contents.  Its contents
    include only embedded frames.  Subclasses of BaseContainer can define/add
    intrinsic contents and let BaseContainer handle them optionally using its
    generic 'Content Object' class.

How to Build:

    To build this part you will need the OpenDoc Release 1.1 toolkit.

    From the basecntr source directory run

    nmake

    To register the part with OpenDoc, run

    nmake ForceRegistry

Usage:

    To run the BaseContainer, issue the command:
       docshell
    and select "IBM BaseContainer Kind" from the dialog box.

    Other parts can now be embedded in the BaseContainer.
    Following editing operations can be performed on BaseContainer:

    Embed -- Click on "Embed" pull-down menu of base container. A list
             of all part handlers that are installed on the system is
             displayed.  This list is created dynamically when base
             container is loaded.  Select a part handler and click in
             base container's client area to embed a part.  BaseContainer
             allows multiple levels of embedding.

    Select -- An embedded part can be selected by 4 ways
             1) Activate the embedded part and click on its activation border
             2) If the embedded part is not active then Shift-Click or
                Ctrl-Click on it
             3) Lasso selection: Hold and drag left mouse button down in
                BaseContainer's client area to get a selection rectangle.
                All the embeds that are in the selection rectangle when the
                mouse button is released are selected
             4) Use 'Select All' menu option from 'Edit' menu.

             BaseContainer allows multiple selection.  Upon Ctrl-Click or
             Shift-Click the selection state of the embed is toggled.
             When the part is deactivated, all the selected parts are deselected.

    Move --  Selection can be moved using the selection border.  One cannot
             move the selection outside the container's boundaries. A single
             selected part can also be moved using 'Move' menu item in 'Edit'
             menu.

    Resize -- A selected part can be resized by stretching its corner or edge
             selection handles.  One can also use 'Resize' menu option from
             'Embed' menu.

    Delete -- Use 'Delete Selection' menu option from 'Edit' menu

    Copy/Paste -- To copy selection, use 'Copy' menu option form 'Edit' menu.
              To paste clipboard contents, select 'Paste' menu and then click
              in client area of the active BaseContainer.

    Drag/Drop -- Press drag-mouse-button in the client area of selection and
              drag it to the desired location either in same docshell or
              another one.  Modifier keys can be used to force a drag-copy or
              a drag-move.

Design Notes:
   For information on how to subclass from the BaseContainer and
   the ContentObject classes, see appendix D of the "IBM OpenDoc
   Programming Guide."

Known Restrictions:

    BaseContainer does not allow "Open As Window" functionality.
    BaseContainer supports icon views, however, the thumbnail view is
    not fully implemented yet. At this time it just displays a large icon
    on a thumbnail size frame.

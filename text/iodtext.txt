Description:

    The Text Import/Export part handler is a sample part which demonstrates
    subclassing from the BaseContainer part handler without using the
    ContentObject model.  It allows the user to import Ascii text files
    and to export them back.

Usage:

    The Text Import/Export part handler has 2 menu items in addition to
    those inherited from BaseContainer, Import and Export.  The Import item
    will allow you to select a text file from disk and import it to the
    docshell.  It will only allow one text file to be imported.  Once text
    is imported, it can be saved to an OpenDoc document and restored from it.
    The Export item will allow you to write the text file back out to disk.
